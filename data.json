        "description":"Today's Indonesia was under Dutch rule until 1942. At that time the large archipelago of islands north of Australia was called Netherlands East Indies, or Dutch East Indies. The Islamic influence is plainly seen in the Arabic writing on the reverse of these coins. This is a long run of coins, all the way from 1855 to 1945. Not surprisingly, older coins are worth more in general.",
